Project sketch

Pick a state: Arkansas.

Arkansas has ____ counties. 

- Car usage by county
- Add major cities to map
- A nice stylized list with population numbers next to the map would be nice. 

Infrastructure spending in your state over the last 20 years
- Can we pull big projects?
- Make sure to include sum.
- Note that comparing across states is not recommended. 

Top non-car mode of transport by county
State vs state comparison:
“Your state is”
x% more likely to drive.
x% less likely to bike.

Selection of cities for which bike lane info has been analyzed + maps
