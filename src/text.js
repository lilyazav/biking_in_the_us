  <h1>Driving is Unsustainable</h1>
  <p>The US has a car problem. In 2021, even with more people working from home due to COVID, more than 75% of American workers commuted to their jobs by private vehicle.<sup>1</sup> In the US, the average car emits 4.6 metric tons of CO2 a year. This is equivalent to driving 11,500 miles in a car that gets 22.2 miles to the gallon. <sup>2</sup> If every adult in the world drove a vehicle like an American, their emissions from driving alone would be more than double the per capita global target emissions.<sup>3</sup> Driving like we do is expensive to our wallets, health, and our planet.</p>

  A lot has been written about car-centric planning in the United States.<sup>4</sup> Most places in the US are designed for people to get around by car, so people that can afford cars, buy cars. However, the US is not uniquely car-obsessed; we are just wealthy. Globally, the more people earn, the more likely they are to own vehicles. <sup>5</sup> This is true across countries, as well as within countries. In Brazil, for example, 66% of high-income earners own cars, as compared to 25% of low earners. <sup>6</sup> Even in a place like Switzerland, which has one of the worldâ€™s best developed public transportation infrastructures, two-thirds of trips are still made by private car. <sup>7</sup> If we want to tackle climate change, we have to do something about cars. Furthermore, we need to look at data coming from the US, not as a unique car-centric outlier, but as a cautionary case study for what many developing countries could look like in 20 years.

const thirdText = <div> Bicycles are a part of the climate change solution. Bicycles can safely and easily use many of the streets already designed for cars, and adding bike lanes and other bike infrastructure is a relatively minor cost as compared to other types of infrastructure projects. In addition, electric bikes sales are surging with 1.1 million e-bikes sold in 2022.<sup>8</sup> E-bikes will allow more people to switch to biking and will enable people who already bike to use their bikes more frequently.</div>;

const fourthText = <div>There is a lot of research on what it takes to get people to switch to their bicycles. This piece does not look at part of the equation. Rather, here I explore how people in the United States commute, where people use modes of transportation other than cars, and what those parts of the country look like.</div>
